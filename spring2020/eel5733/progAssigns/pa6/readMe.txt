For Running My Test Program:
	Prerequisites
	- Compiled and loaded the modified device driver program
	- Compiled my testing program
	- Decide on which deadlock scenario you are wanting to test for with my program

	Running
	1) Run "./deadlockTest <deadlock scenario #>"

	* This program will execute a test for one of the following four scenarios. *

	* After describing each of the following four potential deadlock scenarios,
	  a brief description of the actual test procedure itself will be included. *


Deadlock Scenarios:

	Scenario 1)




		General Test Procedure:


	Scenario 2)




		General Test Procedure:


	Scenario 3)




		General Test Procedure:


	Scenario 4)



		General Test Procedure:




Race Condition Code Reviews:
	
	* In this section, a series of critical regions of code will be described,
	  specifically, the first line numbers and the code on that line will be given
	  to indicate the first and last lines of the chosen critical regions, such that
	  there is no confusion. *

	* Pairs of the described critical regions will be listed, and once pairs are listed,
	  a code review will be given, including listings of the data accessed within that region,
	  the locks held at the time the regions are entered, and reasoning for the possibility
	  or absence of race conditions in the given critical region pair. *

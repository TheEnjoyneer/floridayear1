TEST 1:

System Calls in Test : "write(inode=testInode, offset=0, data="01234567")",  "read(inode=testInode, offset=0, length=8)",

* IM NOT SO SURE THIS SHOULD FAIL, I TRIED THIS AND DIDN'T SEE ANY ISSUE *
* should be fixed with the block list assignment fix, even though idk why this case failed *



TEST 2:

'TEST FAILED    : (copy of file)

* THIS IS BULLSHIT I DO A DEEP COPY EVERY TIME SO IT SHOULD NEVER SHARE BLOCK NUMBERS WITH SOURCE *


TEST 3:

System Calls in Test : "read(inode=testInode, offset=2, length=2)",
\n  EXPECTED: 23\n  ACTUAL: [\'2\', \'3\']\n\n', 

* THIS ONE IS FIXED JUST BY "JOINING" THE LIST BEFORE RETURNING IT *


TEST 4:

* fixed with the block list assignment fix *



TEST 8:

'TEST FAILED : (time modified or time accessed is equal to time created)\n']

* if the program runs all within a second, then the time accessed and modified will equal the time created *
